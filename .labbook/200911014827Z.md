Procedure to follow the exercises.
* go from lesson to lesson in the course until you arrive at one having a programming exercise.
    * For example https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs291/lessons/91073092/concepts/1183049570923 describes an exercise called "Scale a Sphere"
* find the existing .js file corresponding to the exercise

----------------------------------------------- 

NOTE: You see that there are always a pair of .html files below. That's because the one without "-answer" in the name is the "before" snapshot of the exercise, and the one with "-answer" in the name is my solution to the exercise.
    
NOTE: If you see any file with the word ".inlined" in the name, that file has had the [HtmlInliner](https://github.com/pflagerd/HtmlInliner) run on it.

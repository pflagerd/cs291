Procedure to follow the exercises.
* go from lesson to lesson in the course until you arrive at one having a programming exercise.
    * For example https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs291/lessons/91073092/concepts/1183049570923 describes an exercise called "Scale a Sphere"
* find the existing .js file corresponding to the exercise
    * In this example there is a file called scale-a-sphere.js
* rationalize the file's naming
    * In the example the file has inexplicably acquired a redundant prefix "unit4-", so just remove that
    * The file name "scale_exercise" has been badly mangled from the exercise name "Scale a Sphere". Rename it to scale-a-sphere.js.
* Take one of the existing .html files (the one from the most immediately prior exercise is often a good choice) and use gres to modify and copy it.
    *  gres -a clock-exercise scale-a-sphere clock-exercise.html
    * You'll end up with scale-a-sphere.html
* Find the init() function in your .js file and add "the full screen preamble".
    * You're looking for a block like this:
    ```
  	let canvasWidth = 846;
  	let canvasHeight = 494;
  	// For grading the window is fixed in size; here's general code:
  	//let canvasWidth = window.innerWidth;
  	//let canvasHeight = window.innerHeight;
    ```
    * Replace it with this:
    ```
    document.body.style.margin = "0";
    document.body.style.padding = "0";
    document.body.style.overflow = "hidden";

    let canvasWidth = document.documentElement.clientWidth;
    let canvasHeight = document.documentElement.clientHeight;
    ```
* Display this in a browser (do a refresh to make sure you're seeing the latest)
* Now you're ready to solve the exercise. Use gres to make a copy of the file having the suffix 
-answer
    * gres -a scale-a-sphere scale-a-sphere-answer scale-a-sphere.html
    * gres -a scale-a-sphere scale-a-sphere-answer scale-a-sphere.js
* Now make your code changes.
* When you are happy with your code changes, run HtmlInliner on the -answer.html file
    HtmlInliner scale-a-sphere-answer.html
* The result will be a file with the extension ".inlined.html" instead of just ".html"
    scale-a-sphere-answer.inlined.html

----------------------------------------------- 

NOTE: You see that there are always a pair of .html files below. That's because the one without "-answer" in the name is the "before" snapshot of the exercise, and the one with "-answer" in the name is my solution to the exercise.
    
NOTE: If you see any file with the word ".inlined" in the name, that file has had the [HtmlInliner](https://github.com/pflagerd/HtmlInliner) run on it.
